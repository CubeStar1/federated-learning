Healthcare institutions face critical challenges in developing AI models:

\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
    \item \textbf{Data Privacy:} Patient data cannot be shared across institutions due to strict privacy regulations (HIPAA, GDPR)
    \item \textbf{Data Silos:} Individual hospitals have limited datasets, leading to poor model generalization across diverse populations
    \item \textbf{Resource Constraints:} Smaller hospitals lack computational resources and expertise for sophisticated ML development
    \item \textbf{Model Bias:} Single-institution training produces models that don't perform well across different demographics
    \item \textbf{Regulatory Compliance:} Traditional centralized ML approaches violate healthcare data protection requirements
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Research Question:} How can healthcare institutions collaboratively train robust ML models while ensuring patient data never leaves hospital premises?
