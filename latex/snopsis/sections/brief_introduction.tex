This project develops a federated learning platform enabling multiple hospitals to collaboratively train machine learning models without sharing sensitive patient data, addressing critical privacy challenges while leveraging collective intelligence of distributed medical datasets.

\textbf{Scope:} Multi-hospital collaborative model training infrastructure with privacy-preserving architecture, real-time monitoring dashboard, and scalable deployment framework using Flower framework and containerized deployment.

\textbf{Significance:} Enables hospitals to benefit from larger, diverse datasets without violating patient privacy, complies with HIPAA/GDPR regulations, reduces data silos in medical AI research, democratizes access to advanced ML models for smaller institutions, and improves model generalization across diverse patient populations.
