\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
    \item \textbf{System Functionality:} Successfully train models across 3+ hospital nodes with convergence in 50-100 rounds; maintain zero data leakage
    \item \textbf{Model Performance:} Federated model accuracy within 95\% of centralized training baseline; improved generalization across diverse patient populations
    \item \textbf{Communication Efficiency:} 40-60\% reduction in communication overhead compared to naive federated approaches
    \item \textbf{Real-time Monitoring:} Training status updates with <2 second latency via WebSocket connections
    \item \textbf{Scalability:} Support 5-10 concurrent hospital nodes with dynamic addition/removal during training
    \item \textbf{Privacy Verification:} Demonstrated zero patient data transmission with comprehensive audit trails
    \item \textbf{Compliance:} Pass HIPAA and GDPR audit requirements with role-based access control
    \item \textbf{User Experience:} Intuitive dashboards requiring minimal ML expertise; automated alerts for training anomalies
\end{itemize}
